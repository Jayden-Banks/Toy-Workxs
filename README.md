# Toy-Workxs

### App Summary
Toy Workxs is an e-commerce web-application with the intention of creating a realistic shopping experience. This application will let a user create an account, add items/toys to their cart, fake purchase the items, simulate adding shipping information and finally creating an order. The purpose of this project is to showcase my ability to create a fully functional and modern e-commerce application paired with an aesthetic design.
